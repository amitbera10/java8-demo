1. Functional programming:
-> What and why functional programming?
     As wiki "In computer science, functional programming is a programming paradigm—a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs—that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data"
     ->Higher Order Function.
          Function which can receive an function as an argument and also can retun a function. 
     ->Pure Function.
          Function which does not change program state. Any number of time invoking the function with same argument will return same vaule.
          
-> Other JVM language supports functional programming?
    Scala, Groovy, JRuby etc. 
    
-> How we can achieve functional programming in java8? 
    Functional programming in java backed by Functional Interfaces and lamdas. 
    Annoyminus inner classes. 
    
2. Lamda and method reference.
-> What is Lamda?
-> How it works in other languages.
-> How it is implemented in Java.
-> Function pointer.
-> What is method reference?
-> How it works?
-> Type of method reference will discuss in stream. 


3. Functional Interfaces.
-> Single abstract method interfaces.
-> Making lamda backward compatible.
-> Some built-in function. (Consumer, supplier. Function .....)

4. Stream.
-> What is stream?
-> Use stream to refactor code.
-> How it works?
-> Intermediate and terminal operations.
-> Parallel stream.
-> Sharing mutability between stream.
